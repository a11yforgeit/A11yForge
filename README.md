   ```
   then open http://localhost:8000
3. Edit pages in `/pages` and stylesheet in `/css/style.css`
4. Replace inline logo in header/footer (found in each HTML file) if desired.

## Accessibility features
- Skip link, keyboard-accessible navigation
- Floating accessibility panel: dark theme, high-contrast, font-size controls (persisted to localStorage)
